# IslandLoaf Tourism Platform

## Overview

IslandLoaf is a comprehensive tourism booking platform designed for Sri Lanka with global expansion potential. It serves as a marketplace connecting tourism vendors (accommodation providers, tour operators, transport companies, wellness centers) with travelers through an intelligent booking system. The platform features both vendor and admin dashboards, AI-powered marketing tools, and advanced booking management capabilities.

## System Architecture

- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Build Tool**: Vite with hot module replacement

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Storage Layer**: PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM (fully migrated from in-memory)
- **Authentication**: Session-based with JWT support for API access
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with full CRUD operations and real-time data persistence
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for content generation and booking optimization

### Deployment Strategy
- **Platform**: Replit with autoscale deployment
- **Build Process**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend bundling
- **Environment**: Node.js 20 runtime environment
- **Static Assets**: Served through Vite middleware in development, static build in production

## Key Components

## Data Flow

### Storage Provider Pattern
The application uses a flexible storage provider that switches between in-memory storage (development) and PostgreSQL (production) based on environment configuration. This allows for easy development and testing while maintaining production scalability.

### Authentication Flow
1. Session-based authentication for web interface
2. JWT token support for API access and external integrations
3. Role-based route protection with middleware validation
4. Automatic session management with secure cookie handling

### Booking Creation Flow
1. Category selection based on vendor permissions
2. Specialized form rendering for booking type
3. Validation using Zod schemas
4. Database persistence with relationship management
5. Notification system for booking updates

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM and Prisma client
- **AI Services**: OpenAI API for content generation and analytics
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with Shadcn/ui styling
- **Development**: TypeScript, Vite, ESBuild for build processes

### Third-party Integrations
- **Calendar Sync**: iCal format support for external calendar platforms
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration (configured but not fully implemented)
- **External APIs**: Airtable integration for data synchronization
- **Monitoring**: Custom logging with Winston and request tracking

### Development Tools
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking
