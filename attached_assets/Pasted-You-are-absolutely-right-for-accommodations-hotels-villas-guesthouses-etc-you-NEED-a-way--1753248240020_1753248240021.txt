You are **absolutely right**—for accommodations (hotels, villas, guesthouses, etc.), you NEED a way to capture and manage the **room types and bed/amenity details** so you can:

* Display the right options to guests (in your chatbot or booking engine)
* Avoid confusion or wrong bookings (e.g., someone booking a single when they wanted a double)
* Power smart recommendations, filtering, and AI replies

## 🟩 **Here’s the Best Way to Set It Up**

### 1. **Vendor Onboarding (Accommodation Only)**

When a vendor signs up (adds a new accommodation), show extra options for:

* **Room Types:** (e.g., Deluxe Double, Twin, Family Suite)
* **Beds:** (Single, Double, Twin, King, etc.)
* **Amenities:** (AC, WiFi, Pool, Breakfast, Sea View, etc.)
* **Number of Rooms:** How many of each room type available

### 2. **Where to Put This**

* **Vendor Onboarding/Edit Form:**
  When they choose `Business Type = Accommodation`, display the extra section for “Room Details & Amenities.”
* **Database:**
  Store this info in a `rooms` or `accommodation_options` table linked to the property/vendor.
* **Booking Flow:**
  When a customer is booking, they can choose their **room type and beds** (and see what’s available on their dates).

## 🛠️ **What to Build on Replit / What to Tell Your Dev/Agent**

**Here’s exactly what to ask for:**

---

### 📝 **Prompt for Replit Agent or Developer**

> Update the Vendor Management system in IslandLoaf so that when a new vendor is added and the business type is set to “Accommodation”, the admin or vendor must also fill in room and amenity details.
>
> **Requirements:**
>
> * When `Business Type = Accommodation`, show an additional section in the vendor form:
>
>   * **Room Types:** (Text, with “Add Room Type” button to add multiple types)
>   * **Beds per Room:** (Dropdown or checkboxes: Single, Double, Twin, King, etc.)
>   * **Number of Rooms:** (Numeric input per room type)
>   * **Amenities:** (Multi-select: WiFi, AC, Pool, Breakfast, etc.)
>   * **Room Description:** (Optional text field)
> * All room data must be saved in the database and linked to the vendor/property.
> * In the Booking flow, users should be able to:
>
>   * See available room types, bed options, and amenities
>   * Choose their desired option before confirming booking
> * Room availability must be tracked by type (if there are 3 “Deluxe Double”, you can only book up to 3 at a time)
> * This should be editable by the admin and (optionally) by the vendor after onboarding.
> * Add a “Rooms & Amenities” tab in Vendor Management for editing/adding room data for accommodations.

### 🧩 **Database Changes**

* **New Table:** `rooms`

  ```
  id | vendor_id | room_type | beds | num_rooms | amenities | description
  ```
* **Link to Vendor:** Each accommodation can have multiple room types.

---

### 💡 **How it Looks in the Admin/Vendor Dashboard**

**Onboarding or Edit Vendor:**

```
[Add Room Type]
Room Type: [Deluxe Double]
Beds: [Double] [Twin] [King]
Number of Rooms: [3]
Amenities: [WiFi] [AC] [Pool]
Room Description: [Sea view, with balcony...]

[Add Another Room Type]
```

---

### 🟦 **What to Code in React/Frontend**

* When the business type is “Accommodation”, display a **dynamic section** for room types.
* Allow multiple room types to be added/edited.
* Save all data together with the vendor profile.

---

### ✅ **Result**

* Your booking engine and chatbot will be able to **filter/search by room type, bed type, amenities**.
* You can offer accurate options to guests and power up recommendations or AI responses.

If you want, I can write a **sample JSON structure** for your backend, or a **starter React form** code for the “Room Types & Amenities” section.
