üõ†Ô∏è Fix Plan for Island Loaf Dashboard (No Backend Saving Issue)
	1.	User Authentication

	‚Ä¢	Make sure login system connects to the database.
	‚Ä¢	Vendor login (password123) and Admin login (admin123) should be verified against stored credentials.
	‚Ä¢	When creating new users (vendors, admins, etc.), hash passwords before saving and ensure proper user roles are stored.

	2.	Add New Vendor

	‚Ä¢	Implement a backend POST endpoint to receive vendor form data.
	‚Ä¢	Connect it to a database (PostgreSQL, Airtable, etc.) and insert the data properly.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure vendor list fetches from the database.

	3.	Activity Pending Approval

	‚Ä¢	Create a backend route that saves new activities with a ‚Äúpending‚Äù status.
	‚Ä¢	Admin should be able to approve or reject these, triggering status updates in the database.

	4.	Create Booking

	‚Ä¢	Set up a booking endpoint in the backend that receives customer/vendor booking data and saves it.
	‚Ä¢	Retrieve and display the booking data in Booking Manager for vendors and admins.

	5.	New Campaign

	‚Ä¢	Add an endpoint to receive campaign details and store them in the database.
	‚Ä¢	Store type, target audience, dates, and content.
	‚Ä¢	Optional: Connect to an automation system to trigger campaign emails or ads.

	6.	Booking Manager

	‚Ä¢	Fetch all bookings from the database and allow updates or filtering by vendor, date, or status.
	‚Ä¢	Changes like status updates or cancellations must update the database.

	7.	Calendar Sync

	‚Ä¢	Add a field in the vendor profile for their iCal or Google Calendar URL.
	‚Ä¢	Use a scheduled backend task (cron or webhook) to sync availability daily.
	‚Ä¢	Store sync results and timestamps.

	8.	Price Engine

	‚Ä¢	Save property price inputs and AI-generated price suggestions to the backend.
	‚Ä¢	Allow price edits and dynamic price updates to reflect in the frontend instantly.

	9.	AI Marketing

	‚Ä¢	Save campaign input fields to the backend.
	‚Ä¢	Store AI-generated suggestions (captions, target groups, platform selection).
	‚Ä¢	Allow admins or vendors to approve and push these suggestions live.

	10.	Profile Settings

	‚Ä¢	Save updates to name, email, contact number, password, and other details directly to the database.
	‚Ä¢	Add input validation and update logic to prevent overwriting other fields by mistake.

	11.	Live Dashboard Updates

	‚Ä¢	Enable real-time updates using WebSockets (recommended) or polling every 10‚Äì30 seconds.
	‚Ä¢	Any new booking, campaign, or vendor addition should reflect without a full page reload.
