Thanks for sharing the screenshot again. The error **has not changed** even after the frontend code fix. This means the problem is likely not in your button code itself, but **in the underlying way the API endpoint (URL) is being handled in your codebase.**

## üü• What‚Äôs Happening?

* Your frontend is calling a function or variable that is **not a string** when it should be a URL string (like `"/api/keys/generate"`).
* The error pops up **as soon as you click "Generate Key"**, so it's at the point where the fetch/axios request is built.

### PROMPT TO FIX THE ROOT CAUSE

````plaintext
We are getting this error in our React admin panel when generating an API key:

Error: url.startsWith is not a function

What to do:
- Carefully check the code that handles the API call when generating a new API key.
- Make sure the API endpoint URL is a string (like "/api/keys/generate"), not a function, object, or undefined.
- Search for any variable named "url" in this component or any utility/helper being used to send API requests.
- If using a helper like `fetcher(url, ...)` or a wrapper function, check if "url" is accidentally imported or passed as a function.

How to fix:
- If a function is being passed instead of a string, update it so that only the endpoint string is used.
- Replace all `url.startsWith(...)` usages with a check that ensures "url" is a string before calling `.startsWith`.
- If using a config or utility, make sure it returns the correct URL string.

Example working code:
```js
const apiUrl = "/api/keys/generate"; // must be a string
fetch(apiUrl, { ... });
````

Do not use:

```js
fetch(url.startsWith("/api/keys/generate")) // WRONG
```

Check all relevant imports and helpers for this issue!

## üü© What You (the owner) Can Do:

1. **Send the above prompt** to your dev/agent.
2. **Ask them to search the whole project** for `url.startsWith` and see where it‚Äôs used.
3. They should **make sure every API call uses a string URL** (not a function or object).

---

## üí° **Extra Tip:**  
If your codebase uses something like this:
```js
fetcher(apiKeyUrl, ...)
````

But `apiKeyUrl` is actually a function or an object, not a string, you will get this exact error.
**Solution:** Change it to:

```js
fetch("/api/keys/generate", ...)
```

or

```js
fetcher("/api/keys/generate", ...)
```

**If you give me your frontend file (where the API key is generated) or paste the function here, I can show you the exact line to fix.**

Let me know how you want to proceed!
